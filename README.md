# SMART-TRAFFIC-Arduino
Sharan and Swetha Sree contributed to the project by building a prototype and conducting background research on existing patents and research papers. They also aided in accelerating the features of the project and provided valuable insights for documenting reviews and the project report for the traffic system.

Soundarya and Karnika worked on establishing a connection between Arduino and Python using CVlib and Pyfirmata software. They also collaborated on connecting the LCD using a breadboard and implementing it with Pyfirmata. Additionally, they tested various options to make the process more automated and efficient.

Mayank and Rukhsar played the role in the backend of project by implementing the logic and code for the traffic system. Their work involved image detection, object counting, and calculating scores based on the traffic data obtained, and then deciding on which side to be opened first to manage the traffic
